# Eurovision Visualisation and Analysis

PSY_6422 visualisation project page: <https://paulgering.github.io/PSY6422_project/>. 

The aim of this project was to visualise how the changes in the voting system used to determine the winning song 
in the Eurovision Song Contest have affected the points allocated of the winning songs. This was visualised for each year of the competition so that the reader can see the development of the Eurovision Song Contest since the first competition in 1956. 

The project was coded in the statistical environment R. 

/raw contains the raw data used for this project, which was scraped from the Eurovision website <https://eurovision.tv/history>. The codebook is also contained within this folder, which describes the structure of the raw data and the variables used in the R code. 

/figs contains the figures produced from this project as well as the eurovision logo which appears at the top of the RMarkdown page. Since the html versions of the plots are too big to display on github, screenshots have been taken of the html plots and added to github manually.
