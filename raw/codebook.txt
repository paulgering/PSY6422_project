Description of data:
esc_raw_data.csv - 
contains data for all participating songs, countries and artists in the Eurovision Song Contest between 1956 and 2023.

  **X** is the numbered row that the data appears in 
  **R/O Sort descending** is the order in which the songs performed in the contest,
  **Half** is whether the country performed in the first or second half of the contest,
  **Country** is the name of the participating country,
  **Participant** is the name of the artist, 
  **Song** is the name of the song,
  **Points** is the total amount of points each country received, 
  **Rank** is the position which the song achieved in the final, and
  **year** is the year of the competition.
